# Testing

## Test Plan

### UC1

### UC2
For use-case two, the viewing of the crime data by category, the tests that were run are as follows:
- automatic end to end testing was used with test cafe to test the use of search by location function within the sort by location category. Within this test the search bar was selected and a search query was tested to see if the correct results were returned.

### UC3
- For my use-case of the search bar, i managed to succesfully run an a auotmated test. I used test cafe to run the test in which it selected in the search bar and typed a specific search query and returned the correct results.
- For testing the functions of the buttons used within the navigation bars of the webpage, i ran manual tests to see if the correct resulting page was reached and recorded the results below
