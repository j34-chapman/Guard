Key parts of the website design are as follows:

Within the header of the webpage will be a banner with buttons leading to the corresponding utilities such as pictured above. also present in the header is the search bar allowing access to any queries the user may opt to view.

A home page button which will lead to the main page for the user to access all aspects of the website.

Search safest route button will allow the user to view the safest area in ascending order.

View crime by category button will allow the user to access a new page of the website as seen above. From this page there is two new buttons present on a bar beneath the header - view by date and view by location.

The view by date button allows for access to the same bar beneath the header, however now the options for selecting the different dates are present on the bar as buttons. These buttons will grant access to a sorted table corresponding to the respective date.

The view by location button allows for access to the same bar again however there is now a search bar present with the function of searching any queries for similarities to locations within the table. these will then be sorted and displayed to the user upon pressing of the search button.
